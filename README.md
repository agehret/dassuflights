Simple mobile app to track your flights when you are a flight student at Deutsche Alpensegelflugschule (Dassu)

Call this a niche app :-) : It's intended for flight students who learn gliding at the Deutsche Alpensegelflugschule in Unterw√∂ssen / Bavaria / Germany.
The app helps you to do your start check on your mobile phone and keep track of the approximate time of your launch an number of flights during a day.
Just to be be clear: That's it. No tracking of your real launch and landing times, no tracking of your flight path. 
This is mainly because it would be a workaround of a major data architecture issue 
(basically: The leading system that keeps track of flights is a local Access database) that I hope to solve soon. 

This app and code is in no way associated with Dassu, it's a private project.

Written in Flutter, contributions more than welcome.
